Installation Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1 - SOUTSYS load modules should be in a LNKLST dataset.
 2 - Two SOUTSYS load modules (SOUTSEP & SOUTCALL) must reside in MLPA.
 3 - SOUTSYS requires a generic SVC residing in LPALIB.  This module
     is assembled and linked in the last step of member $ASM
 4 - A JES2 output class is requred for SOUTSYS processing.  Default
     is sysout class C.
 5 - After the initial install, DISKWTR must NEVER be manually started
     or data may be lost.  Instead, start SAVEWTR and provide automation
     to start DISKWTR once SAVEWTR has ended.

Tasks to be completed to install and implement SOUTSYS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1 - Issue the $RECEIVE REXX exec to create and populate SOUTSYS
     target libraries.  Review the $RECEIVE member for more information.

       TSO EXEC 'soutsys.install.library($RECEIVE)' EXEC

     After library population, you will be placed in ISPF browse on a
     few members of the INSTALL library

 2 - Make changes to SOUTSYS assembler source (in hlq.ASM) if needed
     o Modify program "SOUTCALL" to point to your generic SVC
       (MVSGPSVC). Default is SVC 252.

     o Modify program "SOUTSEP" to modify JCL procedure names if
       required.
       - When the ACTIVE file is 80% full, SOUTSEP will stop "DISKWTR"
         and start SAVEWTR.  Change these names if required

     o Modify program "CMNFS00@" to set the default number of days to
       display when doing a list (Default is 3 days).

     o If your system does not support EXPDT=99000 (Catalog control)
       then modify program SOUTWTR:
       - Find string "TAPEXPDT" (3 occurences - one is a comment)
       - Uncomment the last 2 occurences to allow for dynamic
         allocation

 3 - Modify SOUTSYS JCL Procedures (in hlq.PROCLIB) if needed
     o Modify DISKWTR procedure
       - Modify PREFIX= parm to set your selected dataset prefix
       - Modify PARM= for the first step to set your JES2 output class
         to be used by DISKWTR for offload

     o Modify SAVEWTR procedure
       - Modify PREFIX= to set your selected dataset prefix
       - Modify DAILY= parm to point daily to tape or disk output
       - Modify DAYS= parm to set the number of days to keep online if
         DAILY=DISK

     o Modify CLEANWTR procedure
       - Modify PREFIX= to set your selected dataset prefix
       - Modify PARM= to set the number of days to keep records
       - Modify PARM= to set the number of lines to report on for large
         outputs

 4 - Modify SOUTSYS ISPPLIB member CMNFS00 to enter your selected
     dataset prefix for variable &CMNFSWTR

 5 - Modify and submit member $ASM to assemble and link-edit SOUTSYS
     load modules.  Return code of 04 is acceptable for the assembly
     steps for modules SOUTSUB and LOCINDEX.

 6 - Copy all members of hlq.PROCLIB to a valid system PROCLIB

 7 - Modify and submit member $ACTIVE to create a SOUTSYS ACTIVE file.
     Expect a D37 abend on the second step of this job.

 8 - Modify and submit member $JOURNAL to create a SOUTSYS JOURNAL
     file

 9 - Provide security for STC's and datasets
     o Add user SOUTSYS
     o Add STARTED profiles for DISKWTR, SAVEWTR and CLEANWTR
     o Add dataset profile for your selected dataset prefix

10 - Copy members SOUTSEP and SOUTCALL from the SOUTSYS load library
     into 'SYS1.LINKLIB' or another load library cataloged in the
     master catalog

11 - Copy member ISPFSOUT to a REXX library within the user SYSEXEC
     concatenation.  Modify if required.

12 - Add the following ISPF panel command to any ISPF panels to gain
     access to SOUTSYS via ISPF.

       SS,'CMD(%ISPFSOUT) SCRNAME(SOUTSYS)'

13 - Add SOUTSEP and SOUTCALL to MLPA list in SYS1.PARMLIB(IEALPA00)
     See SOUTSYS INSTALL member IEALPA00 for a sample.

14 - Add the following statement to 'SYS1.PARMLIB(IEASVC00)'.  Change
     252 and IGC0025B if a different SVC was used.

       SVCPARM 252,REPLACE,TYPE(3),EPNAME(IGC0025B)      /* SOUTSYS */

15 - IPL

16 - Manually start DISKWTR (S DISKWTR).  This will initialize the
     environment.

17 - Test
     o In SDSF (or a similar tool), move output to the designated
       SOUTSYS class and monitor the system log to ensure that
       SOUTSYS has captured the output.  You will simply see messages
       similar to:

         $HASP250 INIT PURGED -- (JOB KEY WAS B94E1EBB)

18 - Add automation to start DISKWTR once SAVEWTR has ended.

19 - Add 'S SAVEWTR' to SYS1.PARMLIB(COMMND00) to start SAVEWTR with
     every IPL
