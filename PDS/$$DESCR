Basically, the system uses an exit to the external writer to write
all sysout for the class chosen to a sequential disk file.  It keeps
track of where every file starts in a Vsam file, and when the  seq.
disk file is full, copies it to a different file on disk and
compresses it.  After a period of time set by the user, each
compressed seq. file is modded onto tape.  ISPF panels are used to
look at any sysout in the system.  Data on tape can be printed to
held output, or looked at online, except you have to wait for the
tape mount.
