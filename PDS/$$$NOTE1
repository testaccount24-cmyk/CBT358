Hi Sam,

I'm a heavy user of a lot of CBT products.  I've installed the
SOUTSYS product but it was a real pain because there were many
pieces missing.  I called and received all the missing pieces
from the original writer and have repackaged it.  I have
successfully installed it on OS/390 2.9 and z/OS 1.4.  It
actually does a fair job of sysout archival.  My client and I
were both pleasantly surprised that it worked well under z/OS
1.4.

So, if it helps, here's the repackaged product.  It would be
great if someone could look at it and make sure it looks right to
ensure that it was packaged correctly and retained proper
notification of 'ownership', etc.

Email, IM or call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
